# SoftwareFormalSpecification_for_ATM

 ATM description:
 
“ATM” or “automated teller machine” or “ABM” (automated bank machine) or “cash
machine” is an electronic banking outlet distributed worldwide that offer and serve to the
customer many options to do basic transactions without need of branch teller. ATM could be
used by anyone having a credit or debit card
ATMs allow people to have quick service alone for example: bill payments, withdrawals,
transfers between accounts … each ban has its own charges for cash withdrawals either by
the operator of the ATM or the bank itself. We can avoid those fees by using the operated
ATM for the holder’s account.
Taking into consideration that ATMs must not make wrong operations because it must
be confidential like the teller in the bank such as giving the right amount of money that the
customer needs or show his right balance without having any error.


Why to develop formally:
We must describe our project specification in a formal way because of many reasons
First point, most of the system uses a software part that must be confidential, secured
and made without any error that can cause the failure of the proceed of the function of
the system because the safety isn’t considered now to the hardware only but the
software must be also secured.
Second point, due to the high technology most of the systems that serve a task for the
humans are very complicated so the specifications must be clearly formally presented to
the developers.
Third point, while using a formal description it is easier to detect any defects or errors or
missing information made by the developers while making the frequently testing and it
helps the testing team to detect this errors earlier as soon as possible.
Fourth point, the importance of using a formal description of the requirement to the
system that it must be very understood to the developing team so they don’t do any
misconception mistakes or misunderstanding mistakes that make the system fail or
crash.
Fifth point, formal specification helps the developing team to fast recognize the
requirements needed for the system as they are described in a way that helps them to
start directly the planning phase without the need to make meeting with the
stakeholders for a missing information or misunderstanding information.
